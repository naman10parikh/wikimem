# Post-Compaction Context Restore V2 — fires via SessionStart with "compact" matcher.
# Injects critical context back into Claude's awareness after auto-compaction.
#
# V2 upgrades (maintainer mandate #9):
#   - Includes maintainer prompt titles for continuity
#   - Includes skills/tools inventory count
#   - Includes handoff doc if exists (bridges sessions)
#
# The stdout of this script gets injected directly into Claude's context.
