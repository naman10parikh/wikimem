# Production pre-compaction memory flush — V2 (March 7, 2026).
# Fires on PreCompact event — last chance to persist before context compression.
#
# UPGRADES over V1:
#   1. Writes anchor-state.md — a structured "what we're doing right now" file
#      that survives compaction because session-start re-loads it
#   2. Tracks compaction count per session for chat-switch warnings
#   3. Saves recent user prompt hints (from daily log) into the anchor
#   4. Structured backup with anchor state pattern (not just file dumps)
