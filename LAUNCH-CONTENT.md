**Tweet 1/6 — Hook**

I took Karpathy's LLM wiki idea seriously.

Built a full CLI + web IDE that compiles any file — PDF, audio, video, Slack export, spreadsheet, URL — into a structured, interlinked knowledge base. Three automations keep it improving while you sleep.

`npx wikimem@latest`

**Tweet 2/6 — The Problem**

The standard answer to "give your LLM memory" is RAG: embed chunks, retrieve on query.

RAG gives you paragraphs. A wiki gives you structure.

WikiMem compiles your sources into entity pages, concept pages, and cross-references — not a vector index. The LLM reads your knowledge base the same way you do.

---

**Tweet 3/6 — Three Automations**

Set up once. Walk away.

1. **Ingest** — file watcher on raw/. Drop a file, get wiki pages + git commit.
2. **Scrape** — RSS feeds, GitHub trending, URLs fetched on schedule → deposited → ingested automatically.
3. **Observe** — nightly LLM quality review. Scores coverage, consistency, cross-linking. Fixes orphan pages. Proposes improvements.

---

**Tweet 4/6 — What It Processes**

13+ formats through specialized processors:

PDF, DOCX, PPTX, XLSX, CSV, JSON, YAML, HTML, images (Vision), audio (Whisper), video (ffmpeg → Whisper), URLs (Firecrawl/fetch), plain text.

One command handles all of them. Output is always structured markdown with wikilinks, frontmatter, and citations.

---

**Tweet 5/6 — Claude Code Integration**

If you use Claude Code, WikiMem has a native MCP server.

Add 5 lines to .mcp.json. Claude gains: wikimem_search, wikimem_read, wikimem_list, wikimem_ingest.

Every conversation can now read your compiled knowledge base directly — no copy-paste, no context-stuffing.

```bash
wikimem mcp
```

---

**Tweet 6/6 — Try It**

```
npx wikimem@latest init my-wiki
cd my-wiki
npx wikimem serve
```

Open localhost:3141. Drop a PDF. Watch it compile.

3 LLMs: Claude, GPT-4o, Ollama (fully local).
Obsidian-compatible output.

**Body:**

Hi HN,

I built WikiMem after spending a few months frustrated with how knowledge compounds — or doesn't. I had notes scattered across Obsidian, research PDFs I'd never revisit, Slack exports I couldn't search, audio recordings from calls. The standard answer is RAG, but RAG retrieves paragraphs. I wanted a compiler: something that takes raw sources and produces structured, interlinked wiki pages I can actually browse, search, and give to an LLM as context.

WikiMem does three things:

**Ingest** (13+ formats): Drop a PDF, audio file, video, spreadsheet, URL, or Slack export. WikiMem detects the type, runs the right processor (pdf-parse for PDFs, ffmpeg+Whisper for video, Claude Vision for images, Firecrawl for URLs), and compiles the content into structured wiki pages — source summary, extracted entities, concept pages, and cross-references. Everything goes to `raw/` first (immutable), then to `wiki/` (LLM-generated). The original source is never modified.

**Scrape**: Configure RSS feeds, GitHub queries, or plain URLs in `config.yaml`. WikiMem fetches them on a cron schedule and deposits the results in `raw/`, triggering the ingest pipeline automatically. Your knowledge base grows from external sources without manual intervention.

**Observe (Self-Improvement)**: A nightly LLM quality review scores every wiki page across five dimensions: coverage (are all raw sources represented?), consistency (do pages contradict each other?), cross-linking (orphan pages, broken wikilinks, missing connections), freshness (are claims superseded by newer sources?), and organization (missing summaries, sparse pages). Pages below threshold get improved automatically.

The output is plain markdown with YAML frontmatter and `[[wikilinks]]` — Obsidian-compatible from day one. Git-checkpointed automatically. Ships with an MCP server for Claude Code and Cursor.

```
npx wikimem@latest init my-wiki
cd my-wiki
npx wikimem serve
```

Web IDE at localhost:3141: D3 knowledge graph, time-lapse viewer (watch the wiki grow commit-by-commit), WYSIWYG editing, Cmd+K search, pipeline visualization.

Works with Claude, GPT-4o, or Ollama (fully local — no API keys, no data leaves the machine). 17 CLI commands, 15K+ lines of TypeScript, MIT licensed.

Happy to answer questions about the self-improvement cycle, the three-layer architecture (raw/wiki/AGENTS.md), or how it compares to vector RAG.

**HN Posting Notes**

- Submit URL: GitHub (more upvotes than npm links)
- Best time: Tuesday–Thursday, 8–10am ET
- Post the body above as your first comment immediately after posting
- Reply to every comment in the first 2 hours
- Do not share the HN link on other platforms (penalized)
- Expected questions and honest answers:
  - "Why not RAG?" — Wiki compiles knowledge (structured, auditable, browsable) vs RAG retrieves chunks (fragmented, context-dependent). Different use case.
  - "Why not Obsidian?" — Obsidian stores what you write. WikiMem compiles what you feed it. You don't have to write anything.
  - "Privacy?" — All local. LLM API calls are optional (Ollama mode is fully offline). raw/ is gitignored by default.
  - "How does self-improvement work?" — LLM scores pages on 5 dimensions, finds orphans and contradictions, applies targeted fixes, logs rationale. You can set a threshold and run --dry-run first.

## 3. Reddit r/ClaudeAI Post

**Title:** I built a CLI skill for managing your knowledge base from Claude Code — compiles PDFs, audio, and URLs into a wiki

---

**Body:**

Been building with Claude Code for a while and kept running into the same problem: knowledge doesn't compound. Every new session starts fresh. You can add context via system prompts or file attachments, but there's no structured way to say "here's everything I've learned and researched — have it available in every session."

WikiMem is my solution. It's a CLI + web IDE that compiles your sources (PDFs, audio, video, URLs, Slack exports, spreadsheets — 13+ formats) into structured wiki pages with cross-references, entity tracking, and citations. Think less "note-taking app" and more "research compiler."

The Claude Code integration is a native MCP server. Add this to `.mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "wikimem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "wikimem", "mcp"],
      "env": { "WIKIMEM_VAULT": "/path/to/your/vault" }
    }
  }
}
```

Then Claude Code has four new tools: `wikimem_search`, `wikimem_read`, `wikimem_list`, `wikimem_ingest`. Every conversation can search your compiled knowledge directly.

The other thing I'm proud of: it has a self-improvement loop. A nightly LLM review scores your knowledge base for coverage, consistency, and cross-linking. Orphan pages get connected. Sparse pages get expanded. Contradictions get flagged. Your wiki gets better while you're not using it.

Quick start:

```bash
npx wikimem@latest init my-wiki
cd my-wiki
npx wikimem serve
```

Open localhost:3141. Drop a PDF in the web UI or via the CLI. It processes, creates pages, and commits to git.

Works with Claude, GPT-4o, or Ollama (no API keys if you go local). Obsidian-compatible output — open the folder in Obsidian, it just works.

**Differentiators to mention in comments if asked:**

- vs Obsidian MCP: reads raw notes, no compilation, no automation, no improvement cycle
- vs Mem0/SuperMemory: those are memory APIs, this is a structured knowledge compiler you browse and edit
- vs plain RAG: wiki is structured and browsable; RAG is opaque chunks at query time

### Description (300 words)

WikiMem turns your raw sources into a structured, interlinked knowledge base — automatically.

Drop a PDF, audio file, video, spreadsheet, Slack export, or URL. WikiMem detects the type, extracts the content, and compiles it into structured wiki pages: source summaries, entity pages (people, organizations, tools), concept pages, and syntheses. Everything cross-referenced with `[[wikilinks]]` and committed to git.

Three automations run the system:

**Ingest** — File watcher on your raw/ folder. Drop a file, get wiki pages. Zero friction.

**Scrape** — Configure RSS feeds, GitHub queries, and URLs. WikiMem fetches them on schedule and deposits results for automatic ingestion.

**Observe** — Nightly LLM quality review. Scores coverage, consistency, and cross-linking. Connects orphan pages. Flags contradictions. Fixes sparse entries. Your wiki improves while you're not using it.

The web IDE at localhost:3141 has an interactive D3 knowledge graph, time-lapse viewer (watch your wiki grow commit-by-commit), WYSIWYG editing, Cmd+K search, and pipeline visualization.

Ships with an MCP server — add 5 lines to .mcp.json and Claude Code gains native tools to search and read your knowledge base in any conversation.

Works with Claude, GPT-4o, or Ollama (fully local, no API keys). Obsidian-compatible — open the vault folder in Obsidian and it just works.

```
npx wikimem@latest init my-wiki
cd my-wiki
npx wikimem serve

### First Comment (post immediately after launch)

Hi Product Hunt,

I built WikiMem because I kept accumulating knowledge without it compounding. PDFs I read once. Audio from calls I never transcribed. URLs I bookmarked. None of it connected.

The core insight is the difference between retrieval and compilation. RAG retrieves paragraphs at query time. A wiki compiles knowledge upfront into structured, navigable, interlinked pages that an LLM (or a human) can actually reason over.

Three things I'm most proud of:

1. **The self-improvement loop** — the Observer automation scores your wiki nightly on five dimensions and applies targeted fixes. Knowledge bases decay without active maintenance. This is the maintenance layer.

2. **The MCP server** — first-class Claude Code integration. Your compiled knowledge becomes ambient context in every session, not something you manually paste.

3. **The three-layer architecture** — raw/ (immutable sources), wiki/ (LLM-generated), AGENTS.md (schema). The schema co-evolves with the wiki. The LLM reads it before every operation. You can change the conventions and the next ingest will follow them.

Try it: `npx wikimem@latest`

I'll be here all day answering questions.

### Key Differentiators (for tagline/description iteration)

1. Compiles, not retrieves — structured wiki vs. vector chunks
2. Self-improving — Observer automation fixes quality issues automatically
3. Claude Code native — MCP server, not a browser extension or API wrapper
